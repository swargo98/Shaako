# Shaako: A Community Health Worker Management System

The goal of the Shaako app is to assist community health workers in diagnosing diseases in rural areas of Bangladesh. There are three separate modules for community health workers, supervisors, and organizations. The organization and supervisors with the web app can manage and educate health workers. Health workers with the mobile app can gather data from patients, diagnose diseases from the given symptoms using a ML model and find the closest hospitals in case of an emergency.
